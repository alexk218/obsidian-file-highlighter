# File Highlighter

**File Highlighter** is an Obsidian plugin that lets you highlight important files in your vault for quick identification. The highlights persist across sessions and work in the default file tree.

⚡ Bonus: Highlights also appear in the [File Tree Alternative](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative)
 plugin if you’re using it.

## Features
- Highlight any file via right-click context menu.
- Highlights are persistent — they remain after reloading or closing Obsidian.
- Works with default file tree and optionally with FTA.

## Installation
1. Copy the `file-highlighter` folder into your vault’s plugin folder:
```
.your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/file-highlighter/
```
2. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community Plugins → File Highlighter.
